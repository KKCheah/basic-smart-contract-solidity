Basic Smart Contract using Solidity with the guidance of the Ethereum Smart Contract Programming course by IvanOnTech blockchain academy

Overview:
This is my 1st attempt using Solidity to program smart contracts using the Remix IDE and cloning the codes into VSCode. It has been my aspiration for the last couple of months to transition from being a mechanical engineering graduate, currently a project engineer to a pathway that personally gravitates to a more meaningful career pathway. It might be tough for now but every single step I take in the direction of both web development and blockchain resonates within me to continue pursuing this pathway. This will be my baby steps to giant strides to achieving new skills and heights and hopefully, contributing back to the peoeple around me, communities and further beyond

Key Areas:
This smart contract runs on solidity version 0.7.5 and consist of basic function such as adding balance to the contract owner, checking balance, transfering balance from owner address to another address and has some levels of error handling such as require() and assert(). More components will be included as I develop more understanding of the syntax and structure of the Solidity language.
